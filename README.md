Python is a vast ocean,learning it completely could be a timeless job especially for beginners branching out in any stream.So,in this repository here,for an aspiring DevOps Engineer I make an effort to jot down some important concepts of Python from a DevOps Engineer POV(Point of View).
Lets staright away get to the lesson without much going much into "if's and but's"...!!!

DevOps engineers should be well-versed in Python's data structures and grammar, which include lists, dictionaries, tuples, strings, numbers, and sets.
This information is necessary to write basic scripts for operations like file manipulation and data processing.

Topic01:

In this topic we will try to clarify the confusion of when to use shell scripting and when to use Python scripting in a DevOps engineers day to day routine.

Yes, definitely! In DevOps, the decision between using Python and shell scripting is based on the particular task or issue you're attempting to resolve. Each has advantages over the other and works well in certain situations. To assist you choose when to use each, consider the following guidelines:

When Should Shell Scripting Be Used?

1. Tasks for System Administration: Automating standard system administration activities, such as file, directory, and process management, is a great use case for shell scripting. Shell scripts can be used for functions including simple file manipulation, user management, and service start/stop.

2. Interactions with Command Line: Shell scripting may be more effective if the majority of your work entails using command line tools and extensions. These tools can be easily called and controlled from a shell script.

3. Quick prototyping: Shell scripting is typically quicker to develop and run if you need to complete one-time activities or rapidly prototype a solution. For ad hoc projects, it works well.

4. Text Processing: For operations involving text manipulation, such parsing log files, replacing and searching text, or extracting data from text-based sources, shell scripting is a good fit.

5. Configuration and Environmental Variables: Shell scripts are in handy when it comes to setting your system and handling environment variables.

When to Use Python?

1. Complicated Logic: Python is a comprehensive programming language that works well for jobs involving intricate data structures, algorithms, and logic. Python might be a better option if your assignment calls for a lot of data manipulation.

2. Code Reusability: Python's structure and modularity facilitate the management and maintenance of code if you intend to reuse it or create larger applications.

3. Error management: When it comes to DevOps, where dependability is essential, Python offers superior error management and debugging capabilities.

4. Compatibility Across Platforms: Python is a superior option for jobs that need to execute on multiple operating systems since it is more platform-independent than shell scripting.

3. Integration of APIs: Python offers a wide range of tools and modules for working with databases, web services, and APIs. It would be advisable to use Python if your assignment requires working with APIs.

6. Advanced Data/Information Processing: Python is a better option if your assignment calls for sophisticated data processing, analysis, or machine learning because of its extensive library ecosystem (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy).
